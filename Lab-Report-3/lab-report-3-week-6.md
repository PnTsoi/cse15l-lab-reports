## Streamlining ssh Configuration
Since Windows doesn't have a reliable text editor in the command terminal that doesn't create a .txt file, what I did was that I run

``` notepad config.txt ```

and then copy the code into the config.txt:

```
Host ieng6
    HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
    User cs15lsp22all
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Since this is not exactly the config file, I will have to copy the content in config.txt to a new file called config.
```
copy config.txt config
```
then I have to delete config.txt
```
del config.txt
```
Now, I will have a config file that has the content of config.txt:

![config](./../Pictures/Lab-3/notepadconfig.jpg)

And I can log in ieng6 like this:

![sshieng6](./../Pictures/Lab-3/sshieng6.jpg)

I can also copy a simple file  from client to server using scp:
![scptoieng6](./../Pictures/Lab-3/scptoieng6.jpg)

## Setup Github Access from ieng6
For this, I created a new SSH id_ed25519 key for my ieng6 account. I added the key into ssh key agent and added it onto Github SSH:

![githubssh](./../Pictures/Lab-3/GithubSSH.jpg)

I also have its private SSH in my ``` ~/.ssh ``` folder in ``` id_ed25519```:

![ed25119public](./../Pictures/Lab-3/id255119.jpg)

Now I will change something on my local test Github repository that I created for this lab report called ```test-Github-Access```. I will commit, then push, to show that it doesn't require me to enter my password. Do note that I needed to do
```
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:PnTsoi/test-Github-Access.git
```
on my local repository first before I can actually use my github access ssh token.

Now I add a commit.txt file into my local repository and commit and push it:
![commitandpush](./../Pictures/Lab-3/commitandpush.jpg)

[This is the link to the commit.](https://github.com/PnTsoi/test-Github-Access/commit/af8b715546759be30991569d8a0e324989d2d8c2)

## Copy whole directories with ```scp -r```
I can copy the whole repository from my client to my ieng6 using :

```scp -r ./markdown-parser ieng6:~/Lab-Report-3```

![scp-r](./../Pictures/Lab-3/scp-r.jpg)

And I can run ```make test``` in my recently copied repository on ieng6:

![mdparseieng6](./../Pictures/Lab-3/mdparseieng6.jpg)

Now, we can copy the repository again and run in one line:
